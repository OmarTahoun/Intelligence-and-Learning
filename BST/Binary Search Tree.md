## This is me attempting to builds a binary search tree with OOP aproach.

+ For the sake of simplicity it generates 10 random numbers between 0-100 and adds them to the tree.
+ It also contains a traverse function that prints the tree in-order.
+ And it has a search function that returns the node that has a specific value if found.
