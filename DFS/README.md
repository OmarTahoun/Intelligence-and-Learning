## Depth First Search
 ### Creating  a maze generator using DFS algorithm (backtracking).
 ### Algorithm:
 ```
       1- Creates a grid that contains 25x25 cells.
       2- Starts from the top left cell in the grid (grid[0]).
       3- Checks all the availble(unvisited) neighbors for that cell
       4- Chooses a random neighbor and make it the current cell.
       5- Add the current cell to the stack.
       6- If there are no available cells; pop a cell from the stack and make it the current cell.
 ```
